**MODULE 2 CHALLENGE**
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The VBA script loops through all the stocks and outputs the following information per year:The ticker symbol.Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year. The yearly change values are highlighted in red for negative and green for positive values. A conditional logic has been used to achieve this highlighting.The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.The total stock volume of the stock.Microsoft Excel & VBA script were used for this project as the logic used for the calculations were complex and would have been a tedious job to manage via Excel formulae. Challenges faced in this project was mainly keeping an optimised code approach around looping through a sheet, say 2018, and identifying the subset of a ticker and calculating the required datapoints.HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT
Open the excel file: Multiple_year_stock_data.xslm. This is the Excel file with ticker data split by year.Click on Developer menu of the Excel file.Click on Macros.In the Macro popup that opens, click on the Macro name “list_trackers” and click on Run.This will execute the Excel Macro and populate the necessary data in the columns.Open the excel file: alphabetical_testing.xslm. This is the Excel file split by ticker data alphabetically.Click on Developer menu of the Excel file.Click on Macros.In the Macro popup that opens, click on the Macro name “list_trackers” and click on Run.This will execute the Excel Macro and populate the necessary data in the columns.
